**Multiclass Classification using stacked LSTM:**

The study aimed to categorize pixels representing crops by treating them as time-series data, as the images spanned a period. Since these images were derived from 30m resolution Sentinel-1 data, it was more effective to use the pixel information as data rather than as an image. Therefore, one of the most suitable models for capturing this information was the Deep Learning model known as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The temporal data covering a full year provides insights into the patterns of changes in the crop throughout its entire cycle of cultivation and harvest.
